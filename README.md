<h1>Meat-Freshness-Detection</h1>
 

In this deep learning project, we have created a real-time, user-friendly app where the user can capture images of meat and instantly determine the freshness level. The dataset was collected from IEEE Dataport and includes classes labeled as 0 hour, 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, and 48 hours.

<b>Features</b>
<p></p>
Real-time meat freshness classification
User-friendly mobile interface
Utilizes a deep learning model optimized with TensorFlow Lite for fast and efficient performance
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is sourced from IEEE Dataport. It contains images of meat categorized into five classes based on their freshness levels:

0 hour
12 hours
24 hours
36 hours
48 hours

<b>Model</b>

The deep learning model was trained using the collected dataset. After training, the model was converted to TensorFlow Lite to be used in the mobile app. The model architecture and training details can be found in the model directory.

<b>App Interface</b>

The mobile app interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Users can capture an image of the meat, and the app will instantly display the freshness level.
